Assignment#1 'Intro to Big Data'

# LAB#1
We will start by building a dataset consisting of the homepages of faculty members from different universitiesâ€™ Engineering and Computer Science departments. To achieve this, you need to identify the faculty directory listing page where all the faculty members of your chosen department are listed and get the urls for the homepages of all faculty members. You then need to scrape all the text information, such as the faculty bio and courses they teach, from the faculty homepage. 
Example:
https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty

My choosen department is this; https://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/faculty
